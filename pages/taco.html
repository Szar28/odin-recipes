    <h2>What you will need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped white onion (from 1 medium onion)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>12 ounces fresh Mexican chorizo</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small avocado, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>1 ounce queso fresco</li>
        <li>8 (6-inch) corn or flour tourfillas, warmed</li>
        <li>Hot Sacue</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together onion, cilantro, lime juice, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt in a bowl.
            Let stand, stirring occasionally, until ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add chorizo. Cook, stirring often 
            and breaking it up using a wooden spoon, until most of the fat has rendered and 
            chorizo is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer to a plate 
            lined with paper towels. Wipe skillet clean.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Add oil to skillet; 
            heat over medium. Add eggs. Cook, stirring constantly, until just set, about 3 
            minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide chorizo, scrambled eggs, avocado, queso fresco, and onion mixture evenly 
            among warm tortillas. Serve with hot sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
