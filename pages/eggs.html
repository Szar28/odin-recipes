        <h2>What you will need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 tablesoon butter</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the the butter in a medium non-stick pan over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and whisk until well blended.</li>
            <li>When the butter begins to bubble, pour in the eggs and immediately use a silicone
                spatula to swirl in small circles around the pan, without stopping, until the eggs
                look slighty thickened and vert small curds begin to form, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>Change from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger, 
                creamy curds; about 20 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>When the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places, remove the pan from the heat
                and leave for a few seconds to finish cooking. Give a final stir and serve immediately. 
                Serve with an extra sprinkle of salt, a grind of black pepper and a few fresh chopped herbs 
                (if desired).
            </li>
        </ol>
